## üåü About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Tufts University**. My research connects device physics with system-level design, focusing on non-volatile memories (NVM) and AI hardware acceleration. I use physics-informed machine learning to create fast and accurate device models, which helps in designing better and more reliable systems.

My main research areas are:
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Modeling and optimizing ReRAM and FeFET devices.
- **AI Hardware Acceleration**: Building efficient systems for edge computing.
- **Physics-Informed ML**: Using deep learning to speed up device simulation.
- **System Co-Design**: Creating frameworks for automated design.
- **Reliability**: Analyzing and improving the resilience of memory systems.

## üìù Featured Work

### PIGen: Generative Physics-Informed Co-Design for ReRAM
*First Author @ IEEE/ACM ICCAD 2025*

PIGen is a framework I developed to speed up the design of ReRAM devices. It uses a mix of physics-informed neural networks and generative models to quickly find optimal device parameters. This work achieved a **93x speedup** over traditional simulations with over **96% accuracy**, making it much faster to explore new design ideas.

### MemSysExplorer (MSX): A Framework for Next-Gen Memory Systems
*Collaborative Research @ NSF CIRC Program*
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-MemSysExplorer-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://
github.com/TuftsECS/MemSysExplorer)
I contributed to the MemSysExplorer project by creating **msxFI**, a Python framework for testing the reliability of deep learning models. It simulates memory faults in NVM and eDRAM to see how they affect neural network performance. This tool helps researchers build more robust AI systems by understanding how hardware failures impact software.

## üí° Passion Project

### Bobi: AI-Powered Smart Food Inventory App

Outside of my research, I love building things that solve real-world problems. That‚Äôs why I created Bobi. Like many people, I often struggled with the daily questions of what to buy, what to cook, and what was left in the fridge. Bobi is my answer, an iOS app that uses AI to simplify food management, reduce waste, and make meal planning easy.

**What it does:**
- **Smart Input**: You can add groceries just by speaking or scanning a receipt.
- **AI Recommendations**: Bobi suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have, your mood, and even the weather.
- **Reduces Waste**: The app keeps track of expiration dates and reminds you to use food before it spoils.

This project was built for fun and is a great example of how I enjoy using technology to create helpful and user-friendly tools.
