## üåü About Me

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Tufts University**, where my doctoral research spans emerging non-volatile memories (NVM), AI/ML hardware acceleration, and advanced device modeling. I bridge device-level physics to system-level PPA (Performance/Power/Area) and reliability decisions using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and generative models (CVAEs).

**My Research Focus:**
- üî¨ **Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)**: ReRAM/FeFET device modeling and optimization
- üöÄ **AI Hardware Acceleration**: Designing efficient architectures for edge computing and XR systems
- üß† **Physics-Informed ML**: Combining PDEs with deep learning for rapid, accurate device simulation
- ‚ö° **System Co-Design**: Automated technology-application co-design frameworks
- üõ°Ô∏è **Fault Injection & Reliability**: Memory fault modeling and DNN resilience analysis for NVM and eDRAM systems

**Recent Highlight:**
My first-author work on the **PIGen framework** (ICCAD 2025) achieved up to **93x speedup** (on Intel i9 + RTX 3090) over traditional SPICE simulations while maintaining over **96% accuracy** in key switching dynamics, enabling rapid and robust co-design exploration even from sparse data.

**Education:**
- üéì **Ph.D. in ECE** | Tufts University (2021 - Present)
- üéì **M.S. in Computer Engineering** | University of Delaware (3.97/4.0 GPA)

### üéØ PIGen: Accelerating Re-RAM Co-Design via Generative Physics-Informed Modeling

<div align="center">

**Zihan Zhang** and Marco Donato

*IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (**ICCAD 2025**)* | October 2025

**Abstract:** Resistive Random-Access Memory (ReRAM) offers promising capabilities for data-intensive computing, but optimizing device parameters across diverse materials and operating conditions presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce **PIGen**, an integrated framework that bridges device physics and system-level performance targets through a dual approach: a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for efficient device modeling and a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for design parameter generation. The PINN model integrates physical constraints with data-driven learning, demonstrating superior accuracy in predicting ReRAM switching dynamics even with sparse training data‚Äîa critical advantage when experimental measurements are limited. Building upon this foundation, the CVAE-based generative system translates user-defined performance targets (endurance, latency, energy) into optimized design parameters (material, voltage, pulse width). This unified approach enables automated technology-application co-design, providing up to **93√ó computational speedup** over traditional simulations while maintaining high prediction accuracy across multiple ReRAM materials. By automating parameter optimization and supporting rapid design space exploration, our framework significantly facilitates the development of tailored ReRAM solutions for diverse application requirements, potentially including energy-constrained IoT devices and high-performance computing systems.

## üí° Research Philosophy

> *"The best device models don't just simulate reality‚Äîthey illuminate the physics and accelerate innovation."*

I believe in bridging the gap between fundamental device physics and practical system design. By combining physics-informed machine learning with generative models, we can accelerate the design cycle while maintaining physical accuracy and enabling robust co-design exploration.
